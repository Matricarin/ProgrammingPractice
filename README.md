## Task 1

Write a program to analyze the frequency of word usage in a text file. 
The program takes the name of a text file as input. 
The program's output is a CSV file in the format: word, frequency, frequency in %. 
The words in the output file must be sorted in descending order of frequency.

## Task 2

Write a stack-based calculator that accepts the name of a file containing commands as a command-line argument. 
If no argument is provided, use the standard input stream to read commands. Use floating-point numbers.

    1. Implement a set of modular tests covering the calculator's functionality.
    2. Implement logging of the calculator's operation process.
